      "url": "",
      "summary": "Proposed an algorithm for task scheduling in fog systems, addressing priority levels, deadline constraints, and inter task dependencies utilizing Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), priority queues, and dynamic queue switching. Contributed to algorithm development by identifying limitations and making strategic adjustments to enhance performance. Implemented simulation programs in Java and recommended configurations for experiments. Simulation results showed significant improvements in response time, makespan, throughput, and task completion rate, particularly with tasks that have inter-dependencies."

      "summary": "Developed an efficient deep learning architecture with sequential 1D, 2D, and 3D feature extractors to capture intra and interchannel dependencies in ECG signals, improving cardiovascular disease detection accuracy. the architecture was evaluated on a large publicly available dataset containing ECG signals from over 10,000 patients, achieving an accuracy of 97.3% in classifying six heartbeat rhythms. Additionally, introduced a novel knowledge distillation framework that transferred knowledge from a high-performing teacher model to a student model, reducing the number of trainable parameters by up to eight times while significantly improving efficiency and reducing complexity."

While RNN models are generally recognized for their effectiveness with time series data, in our experiments CNNs outperformed them by effectively learning local data patterns, as indicated by performance metrics such as MSE, nRMSE, and MAPE."
