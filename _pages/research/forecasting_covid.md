Worked under the guidance of [Khondoker Nazmoon Nabi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=x_5tUYUAAAAJ&hl=en). In this project, we compared the forecasting capabilities of several deep learning models, including CNN, LSTM, GRU, and multivariate CNN, for predicting COVID-19 cases in three countries. While RNN models are generally recognized for their effectiveness with time series data, in our experiments CNNs outperformed them by effectively learning local data patterns, as indicated by performance metrics such as MSE, nRMSE, and MAPE.
