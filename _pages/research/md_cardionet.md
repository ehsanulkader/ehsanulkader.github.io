Developed an efficient deep learning architecture with sequential 1D, 2D, and 3D feature extractors to capture intra- and interchannel dependencies in ECG signals, improving cardiovascular disease detection accuracy. Introduced a novel knowledge distillation framework that transfers knowledge from a high-performing teacher model to a student model with significantly fewer parameters. Achieved satisfactory performance in the student model while maintaining efficiency and reducing model complexity.
