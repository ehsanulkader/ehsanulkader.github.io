Worked under the supervision of [Dr. Shaikh Anowarul Fattah](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qDG3vBUAAAAJ&hl=en) and Tanvir Mahmud [https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4aZPxRsAAAAJ&hl=en]. In this project, we developed an efficient deep learning architecture with sequential 1D, 2D, and 3D feature extractors to capture intra- and interchannel dependencies in ECG signals, improving cardiovascular disease detection accuracy. We evaluated the architecture on a large publicly available dataset
containing  ECG signals from over 10,000 patients, achieving an accuracy of 97.3% in classifying six heartbeat rhythms. Additionally, we introduced a novel knowledge distillation framework that transferred knowledge from a high-performing teacher model to a student model, reducing the number of trainable parameters by up to eight times. The student model maintained strong performance while significantly improving efficiency and reducing complexity.
