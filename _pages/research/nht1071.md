#### **NHT1071: A Traffic Image Dataset for Non lane-based and Heterogeneous Traffic for Adaptive Traffic Signal Scheduling**

`Traffic Image Dataset` `Vehicle Detection` `Intelligent Traffic Signaling` <br>
_Jun 2023 - May 2024_

Dataset preparation for traffic signaling in context of the non-lane based, heterogeneous traffic of Dhaka city. In collaboration with [Hasan Masum](https://hmasum52.github.io/), [Masfiqur Rahaman](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kO1x10QAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr. A.B.M. Alim Al Islam (BUET)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=K-AIPzQAAAAJ&hl=en), the Non-lane based Heterogeneous Traffic dataset NHT1071 was prepared with 1071 traffic images from different locations in Dhaka city, taken in various times of the day. The dataset was prepared to train the object detection model for the intelligent traffic signaling system.
