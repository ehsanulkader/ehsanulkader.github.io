Working under [Golam Md. Muktadir (UC Santa Cruz)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RDa4TOgAAAAJ&hl=en), [Dr. A.B.M. Alim Al Islam (BUET)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=K-AIPzQAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr. Mahmuda Naznin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dJx58AQAAAAJ&hl=en) on a project to find out metrics for evaluating generative pedestrian models in autonomous vehicle simulations. The pedestrian behavior observed in real-world data is used to prepare metrics for assessing how realistic generative pedestrian models are. We analyze extracted trajectories from real-world pedestrian datasets and characteristics are determined from such data. Data analysis, visualization, and statistical modeling are the primary tools used in this research.
