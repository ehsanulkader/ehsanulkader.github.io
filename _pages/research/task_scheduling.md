Proposed an algorithm for task scheduling in fog systems, addressing priority levels, deadline constraints, and task dependencies
utilizing Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), priority queues, and dynamic queue switching. Contributed to algorithm development by identifying limitations and making strategic adjustments to enhance performance. Implemented simulation programs in Java and recommended configurations for experiments. Simulation results showed significant improvements in response time, makespan, throughput, and task completion rate, particularly with tasks that have inter-dependencies.
