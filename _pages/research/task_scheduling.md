Undergraduate thesis project under the supervision of [Dr. Rezwana Reaz](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=I0k0ReMAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). In this work, I co-developed an algorithm for dynamic task scheduling in fog systems, addresses the challenges of scheduling tasks with varying priority levels, deadline constraints, and dependencies utilizing the concepts of Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), priority queues, and dynamic queue switching. My contributions included algorithm development by identifying limitations and making strategic adjustments in each iteration to enhance performance. I implemented simulation programs in Java and recommended configurations for experiments. Task lengths in our generated dataset were derived from the GoCJ dataset, which provides real-world data on various job characteristics. The simulation results showed significant improvements in response time, makespan, throughput, and task completion rate, especially for workloads with high task inter-dependencies.
