- Co-developed FPL Analytica, a Fantasy Premier League replica, where users manage a squad with a limited budget, make transfers,
adjust lineups, and join or create leagues to compete with others.
- Utilized the Django-REST framework for developing the API and Oracle for the database.
- Used React for the frontend and Redux for state management.
