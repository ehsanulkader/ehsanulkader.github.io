- Implemented Adaptive Queue Management with Random Dropping (AQMRD) algorithm that reduces the limitations of Random
early detection (RED) active queue management (AQM) scheme.
- Added an adaptive threshold between the lower and upper limits that incorporates both the average queue size and its rate of
change
