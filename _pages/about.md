  üéì Graduated (B.Sc.) from CSE, BUET <br>
  üë®‚Äçüéì Prospective Graduate Student <br>

</small>

I am Ababil (Aa-baa-beel), and I have recently graduated from [CSE, BUET](https://cse.buet.ac.bd/). I am currently as a Software Engineer at [Synesis IT PLC](https://www.synesisit.com.bd/). My research interests are related to **Intelligent Transportation Systems**, **Cyber-Physical Systems**, and **Autonomous Vehicles**. I am aiming to pursue a PhD program in relevant fields to further delve and make a significant contribution in these areas.

Most of my research is focused on intelligent transportation and relevant systems. Currently, I am involved in a research project supervised by [Golam Md. Muktadir (UC Santa Cruz)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RDa4TOgAAAAJ&hl=en), [Dr. A.B.M. Alim Al Islam (BUET)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=K-AIPzQAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr. Mahmuda Naznin (BUET)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dJx58AQAAAAJ&hl=en) where we are working on **evaluating generative pedestrian modeling in autonomous vehicle simulations**. We utilize behavior observed in real-world data to prepare metrics for assessing how realistic generative pedestrian models are. Data analysis, visualization, and statistical modeling are the primary tools used in this research.

My undergraduate thesis, supervised by [Dr. A.B.M. Alim Al Islam (BUET)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=K-AIPzQAAAAJ&hl=en), was on the development of an **intelligent traffic signaling system suited to the non-lane based, heterogeneous traffic** of Dhaka city. In this study we propose a system architecture that detects traffic through object detection ina low resource environment and optimizes the signal cycle accordingly. We also implemented the architecture as a testable physical system using IP Cameras and Raspberry Pi. We have worked on real-time video processing, object detection in low-resource environments, and multi-objective optimization algorithms. We also tested our system at a nearby intersection and evaluated the effectiveness of our proposed architecture. Before our thesis, we had worked on the preparation of a dataset **NHT-1071** based on the traffic scenario in Dhaka city, which was used for training the object detection model.

I am assigned to the Convay team under the Software Development and Implementation department at Synesis IT, where we develop and maintain [Convay](https://www.convay.com), a video conferencing web application that also provides collaborative features. I am currently working on the front end of the application.

I have been involved in leading and organizing different sorts of events in my student life, the most prominent being [BUET CSE Fest 2023](https://buet-cse-fest-2023-main-mauve.vercel.app/). I am a passionate Manchester United fan, and I love to talk sports. I also like listening to music, binge-watching TV shows, and traveling whenever I get the chance.
