I am Ehsan. I am currently working as a Lecturer in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering, BRAC University](https://cse.sds.bracu.ac.bd/). I have recently completed my undergraduate degree from [Department of Computer Science and Engineering, BUET](https://cse.buet.ac.bd/). My current research interests include Systems, Security, Networking and Databases. I am particularly interested in exploring **Distributed Systems** and **Operating Systems** in depth, with a focus on solving complex problems in these areas. I plan to pursue a PhD to expand my knowledge and contribute to research and innovation in these areas.

I began my research journey by collaborating on a project that tested the forecasting capabilities of various deep learning models, including CNN, LSTM, GRU, and multivariate CNN, for predicting COVID-19 case trends across three countries. Next, I contributed to developing a deep learning architecture that used sequential 1D, 2D, and 3D feature extractors to capture intra- and inter-channel dependencies in ECG signals. This approach significantly improved the accuracy of cardiovascular disease detection. We also introduced a knowledge distillation framework to transfer knowledge from a high-performing teacher model to a student model with fewer parameters. Papers from both of these projects led to publications in academic journals.

My undergraduate thesis was titled **Dependency and Priority Based Multi-Queue IoT Task Scheduling in Heterogeneous Fog Systems** which was supervised by [Dr. Rezwana Reaz](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=I0k0ReMAAAAJ&hl=en). In this work, we developed a non-preemptive batch task scheduling algorithm that dynamically allocates resources for executing IoT tasks in a fog node. The algorithm takes into account the heterogeneity of fog resources, as well as the priority, deadline constraints, and dependencies between tasks. 

In my current role, I teach the courses Data Structures and Algorithms within the Computer Science and Engineering department. I also taught an introductory programming lab focused on Java, where I guided students through the basics of programming.

Outside of work, I enjoy watching and discussing sports. I am a passionate Liverpool Football Club fan and have been following them for around 15 years. I also love traveling whenever I have the opportunity and have been fortunate enough to visit the Chittagong Hill Tracts, as well as the beautiful regions of Shimla and Manali.
